# Work 1
- Rewrite the BF language syntax to make it readable using a tokenizer to recognize the tokens: begin, end, inc (increment), dec (decrement), fwd (forward), rwd (go back), read, write.
- Add the commands inc N (increment N times), dec N (decrement N times), fwd N (forward N times), rwd N (go back N times).
- Rewrite the Work 1, Hello World and Factorial Generator programs in this language.

# Work 2
- Increase memory area to 65536 bytes.
- Create multiple registrars. For example:
  - (r0 - points instruction) PC;
  - (r1 - points stack) STK;
  - (r2 – points frame) FRP;
  - (r3 - accumulator) ACC;
  - (r4 – general registration) BR,
  - (r5 – general registration) CR, (r6 – general registration) DR
- Create a language with commands similar to an assembly language, move, load, store, add, inc, dec jump, jmpc (conditional jump)
- Write a program in this language
